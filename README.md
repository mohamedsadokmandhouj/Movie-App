PopcornBox Movie App
Project Description
PopcornBox is a movie app built from scratch that allows users to browse, filter, and explore movies and TV series. This app includes a fully responsive design, a login and registration system, and functionality to view detailed movie descriptions and trailers. Admin users have the ability to manage movie listings by adding, editing, or deleting movies.

Technologies Used
Frontend
React
React-Bootstrap
Axios
Backend
Express.js
Node.js
MongoDB (Mongoose)
Project Goals
The main goal of this project was to develop a complete movie application that provides a smooth and engaging user experience. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in building full-stack applications while implementing complex functionality like dynamic routing, user authentication, and movie data management. It was challenging at times, but I gained valuable experience in integrating frontend and backend systems.

Features
Responsive multipage movie application
User login and registration system
Dynamic movie and TV series listings with ratings and descriptions
Ability to view movie trailers
Search and filter movies by rating or genre
Admin panel for managing movie data (add, edit, delete)
Setup
To set up, you need a MongoDB account and to configure your environment variables in the .env file. The app consists of two parts (client and server), and each will require a separate terminal to run.

Starting the Backend
cd server

then

nodemon app.js

Starting the Frontend
cd client

then

npm start

Project Status
This project is functional, but I continue to refine and add more features. Currently, all the core features are working, including user authentication, movie browsing, and dynamic trailer viewing. Future updates may include additional filters and social sharing options.

Thank you for checking out PopcornBox!
